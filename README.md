Part of my Computer Science degree at Curtin University. My final mark was 88%.

There's no proper commit history because it wasn't developed using GitHub.

Syllabus:

> This unit introduces students to the C programming language and the related concepts and tools used to design, implement, test and debug C programs. Topics covered include: C Fundamentals. Functions and program structure. Designing programs with derived types. Pointers. Abstract data types. Strings, streams and input/output (I/O). Dynamic memory allocation and C programming utilitiers for program construction and diagnosis.

## [Assignment](Assignment)

A simple game of tic-tac-toe with two human players. The board size and number of matches in a row to win is given as command line arguments. Uses a generic linked list to store logs and print them to file. Has conditional compilation in make to allow settings to be changed at run time or to disable logs.

## [Practical Excercises](Practical%20Excercises)

Weekly asessed assignments to demonstrate that week's course content. I don't provide the worksheets that these are based on for copyright reasons so they don't make a lot of sense without context.
