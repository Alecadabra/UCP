## [Assignment](Assignment)

A simple game of tic-tac-toe with two human players. The board size and number of matches in a row to win is given as command line arguments. Uses a generic linked list to store logs and print them to file. Has conditional compilation in make to allow settings to be changed at run time or to disable logs.
